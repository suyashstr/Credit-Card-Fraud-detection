<p id="description">This repository contains a project focused on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The project aims to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions. Dataset The dataset used in this project is a collection of credit card transactions with features that have been transformed the dataset is highly imbalanced with the majority of transactions being non-fraudulent.</p>
