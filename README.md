<p id="description">This repository contains a project focused on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The project aims to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions. Dataset The dataset used in this project is a collection of credit card transactions with features that have been transformed the dataset is highly imbalanced with the majority of transactions being non-fraudulent.</p>

<h2> Summary: Credit Card Fraud Detection Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  
Goal:
The goal of this project is to build a system that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions. This helps in preventing unauthorized transactions and protecting both consumers and financial institutions.

<h2>Steps Involved:<h2>
Data Collection:
We started by collecting a dataset containing information about various credit card transactions. Each transaction includes details like the amount spent, the time of the transaction, and other specific indicators.

Data Preparation:
We loaded the dataset into a format that our tools can understand. This step is like organizing data in a spreadsheet so that it's easy to work with.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We examined the data to understand it better. This included looking at patterns and identifying any missing or unusual values. For example, we checked the average spending amounts and how frequently fraud occurred.

Splitting the Data:
We divided the data into two parts: one for training our system and the other for testing it. This is similar to studying with a portion of your notes and then taking a quiz to see how well you've learned.

Model Training:
We used a technique called Logistic Regression, which is a type of mathematical model, to teach our system to recognize fraudulent transactions. The model looks for patterns in the data that are common in fraud cases.

Model Testing:
After training, we tested the model with the data we set aside earlier. This step checks how well our system can identify fraud without having seen those transactions before.

Evaluation:
Finally, we measured how accurately our system could detect fraudulent transactions. The better the accuracy, the more reliable the system is in catching fraud.</p>
